# ‚úÖ Gemini Prompt Checklist for Resume Accuracy

Ensure your resume is error-free, targeted, and compelling by using these structured prompts with Gemini to verify accuracy and effectiveness before applying.

## üìù Factual Accuracy & Consistency Check

**Prompt Gemini to identify potential errors or inconsistencies**

```
Please carefully review my entire resume draft [paste text or upload file]. Check for:
- Factual accuracy in job titles, companies, and dates.
- Consistency in formatting (e.g., date formats, bullet styles).
- Correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
Highlight any potential errors or inconsistencies you find.
```

**üéØ Alignment with Target Role Check**
Verify that your resume clearly aligns with the specific job you're targeting:

```
I am targeting the role of [Target Role Title] at [Company Name, if known]. Here is the job description [paste description or upload file]. Review my resume draft [paste text or upload file] specifically for alignment with this role.
- Does my summary clearly target this role?
- Are my most relevant skills and experiences prominently featured?
- Are there any sections or bullet points that seem irrelevant or misaligned for this specific job?
Suggest improvements to strengthen the alignment.
```

**ü§ñ ATS & Human Readability Check**
Get feedback on how both software and humans might perceive your resume:

```
Analyze my resume draft [paste text or upload file] from two perspectives:
1.  **ATS Compatibility:** Are there formatting issues (columns, graphics, non-standard fonts), lack of keywords (compared to the target role/industry), or structural problems that might cause issues for Applicant Tracking Systems?
2.  **Human Readability:** Is it easy to skim? Is the key information clear? Is the language professional and engaging? Are there any confusing statements or jargon (beyond industry standard)?
Provide feedback for both perspectives.
```

**üîç Final Hiring Manager Review Simulation**
Prompt Gemini to adopt the persona of a critical hiring manager:

```
Act as a skeptical hiring manager for the role of [Target Role Title]. Review my resume draft [paste text or upload file] critically. What are the weakest parts? Are there any red flags, unclear achievements, or confusing statements that would make you hesitate to offer an interview? What specific improvements would make it a stronger application from your perspective?
```

üöÄ **How to Use with Gemini**
- Use these prompts after you have a solid draft.
- Provide the target job description whenever checking for alignment.
- Address the feedback Gemini provides, then consider running the check again on the revised version.

Using these prompts systematically with Gemini helps ensure your resume clearly communicates your strengths, aligns precisely with your target roles, and avoids common errors.
