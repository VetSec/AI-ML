## ðŸ“Œ Steps & Explicit Prompts:

### 1. ðŸ“‘ **Brag Doc Setup:**
Before building your resume, clearly gather all relevant achievements and impactful experiences:

```
Clearly document your career achievements explicitly, starting each sentence with action-oriented words:
- Built...

- Automated...
- Saved $...
- Prevented disaster when...
```

### 2. âœ¨ **Conversion Prompt:**
Transform your raw accomplishments into concise, powerful resume bullets:

```
Clearly rewrite these achievements into concise resume bullets. Use past tense, clearly quantify the impact, utilize strong action verbs, and explicitly mention relevant technology or tools.
```

### 3. ðŸš€ **Set Your Vibe:**
Clearly define the confident, impactful tone and style of your resume:

```
My resume's tone should be explicitly confident, technical, and direct. Clearly focus on leadership, autonomy, and measurable results. Avoid fluff; I deliver results without needing permission.
```

### 4. ðŸŽ¯ **Role Alignment:**
Explicitly align your resume content to the targeted role for maximum relevance and impact:

```
I am clearly targeting a [specific role]. Explicitly outline what skills, accomplishments, and keywords I must clearly emphasize to effectively appeal to recruiters and hiring managers.
```

### 5. ðŸŽ¯ **Precision Bullet Formatting:**
Craft your resume bullets clearly for maximum clarity, brevity, and impact:

```
Explicitly rewrite each bullet point using this structure:
[Strong Action Verb] + [Quantified Result or Clear Impact] + [Relevant Tech Context], clearly keeping each bullet under two lines.
```

### 6. ðŸ’¥ **Brutal Feedback:**
Request explicit, no-nonsense feedback to significantly enhance resume effectiveness:

```
Clearly roast my resume from a hiring manager's perspective. Explicitly highlight what's weak, generic, unclear, or ineffective.
```
