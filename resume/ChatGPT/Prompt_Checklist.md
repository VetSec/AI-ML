# ✅ Prompt Checklist for Resume Accuracy

Ensure your resume is error-free, targeted, and compelling by clearly using these structured prompts to verify accuracy and effectiveness:

## 📝 Factual Accuracy Check

Prompt ChatGPT explicitly to identify factual inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and errors:

```
Review my resume carefully for factual accuracy, consistency across dates, proper spelling, grammar correctness, and punctuation accuracy. Clearly highlight any errors or inconsistencies.
```

## 🎯 Alignment with Target Role

Ensure your resume clearly aligns with your intended career goals and the specific job you're targeting:

```
Double-check my resume against the role of [target role]. Clearly highlight any areas that are misaligned or irrelevant, and suggest improvements to strengthen alignment.
```

## 🤖 ATS & Human Reviewer Check

Get explicit feedback on potential ATS filtering issues and how human reviewers might perceive your resume:

```
Roast my resume explicitly from both an ATS and recruiter perspective. Clearly flag formatting issues, problematic wording, missing keywords, or sections that may confuse either an ATS system or a human reviewer.
```

## 🔍 Final Hiring Manager Review

Imagine the final stage: clearly prompt ChatGPT to scrutinize your resume as a critical hiring manager might:

```
Pretend you're a hiring manager reviewing my resume for the role of [target role]. Explicitly point out any red flags, unclear statements, or confusing points that might prevent me from receiving an interview.
```
