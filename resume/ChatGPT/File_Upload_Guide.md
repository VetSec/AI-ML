# 📂 ChatGPT File Upload Guidance

Maximize the effectiveness of your interactions with ChatGPT by clearly uploading appropriate files in the optimal formats.

## ✅ Recommended File Types:

- **PDF (.pdf)**: Ensure PDFs contain clean, selectable text rather than scanned images.
- **Microsoft Word (.docx)**: Ideal for detailed resumes and editable documents.
- **Plain Text (.txt)**: Best for simplicity and rapid processing.
- **Markdown (.md)**: Excellent for clear structure, readability, and formatting clarity.

## 📁 What to Upload:

Clearly upload documents that provide comprehensive context for your requests:

- **Current Resume**: For clear reviews, ATS optimization, and improvement suggestions.
- **Brag Document**: A clearly outlined list of your career accomplishments to build effective resume bullets.
- **Job Descriptions**: Clearly specify roles you’re targeting to align resumes effectively and identify necessary keywords.

## 🚫 Avoid Uploading:

- **Scanned PDFs or Images**: These formats hinder text extraction, limiting ChatGPT's ability to process and review clearly.
- **Complex or Graphics-heavy Documents**: May cause readability issues and unclear outputs.

## 📝 Effective Prompt Examples Post-Upload:

Explicitly instruct ChatGPT to leverage your uploaded files effectively:

```
Clearly review the uploaded resume and highlight any unclear statements or areas needing improvement.
```

```
Using the uploaded brag document, rewrite my achievements clearly into strong, quantified resume bullets.
```

```
Compare my resume to the uploaded job description and clearly indicate missing ATS keywords or alignment issues.
```

### 🚀 Best Practices:
- Always verify files have selectable text by copying text into a plain text editor first.
- Clearly specify your objectives when instructing ChatGPT post-upload to achieve precise outcomes.

Use these guidelines to ensure clear and productive engagements with ChatGPT every time.

**Upload smart. Achieve clearly defined results. 🚀**
