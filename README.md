# AI/ML Assistance Guidance (VetSec AI-ML Repo)

**Repository:** `https://github.com/VetSec/AI-ML`

**Description:** Guidance and tooling on using models like ChatGPT and Gemini to assist with various things.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of practical guides, prompts, and strategies for effectively leveraging large language models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. The aim is to provide actionable advice to assist with various tasks, with an initial focus on career transition tools, particularly for the veteran community.

## Contents

This repository will contain:

* **Detailed Guides:** Step-by-step instructions on using AI for specific tasks (e.g., resume building, cover letter drafting, interview preparation).
* **Prompt Libraries:** Curated lists of effective prompts tailored for different models and objectives.
* **Best Practices:** Tips and techniques for getting the most out of AI interactions.
* **(Future) Tooling:** Scripts or configurations related to using AI models (if applicable).

## Initial Guidance: Resume Building

The first set of guides focuses on using AI (specifically Gemini and ChatGPT) to create high-impact resumes:

1.  **[Guide: Creating the Perfect Resume with Gemini](./GUIDE_Gemini_Resume_General.md)** *(You'll need to save the general guidance here)*: Comprehensive steps, prompts, and strategies for general resume creation using Gemini.
2.  **[Guide: Creating Your Post-Military Resume with Gemini](./GUIDE_Gemini_Resume_Veteran.md)** *(You'll need to save the veteran-specific guidance here)*: Tailored guidance specifically for military veterans transitioning to civilian roles, focusing on translating experience and addressing unique aspects like security clearances.

*(Please note: You will need to copy the guidance text I previously provided into separate `.md` files within the repository and link them correctly above.)*
